# Udemy_Course_Analysis
The analysis of a dataset of 3,682 Udemy courses covering four major topic areas—business finance, graphic design, musical instruments, and web design—is the main goal of this study. Anyone can build and publish courses on the popular massive open online course (MOOC) platform Udemy. The platform is therefore a great source of educational data for study, hosting a wide range of content, both paid and free.
The dataset includes detailed information about each course, such as the course title, price, number of subscribers, number of reviews, and the number of lectures. It also provides metadata like the course's difficulty level, total content duration (in hours), and the date the course was published. Each course is categorized under one of the four subjects mentioned above, and it also includes a direct URL to the course page on Udemy.
The primary objective of this project is to uncover trends and patterns in the data that can offer insights into what makes a course successful on Udemy. Some key questions explored in the analysis include: What subjects are the most popular? Do paid courses perform better than free ones in terms of engagement? Is there a relationship between the number of lectures or course duration and the number of subscribers or reviews? Additionally, the project examines how pricing varies across subjects and whether price influences course popularity.
